# Signpost XBlock

A simple XBlock for creating and displaying signposts to students, highlighting activities such as participating in discussions, external research or just about anything else.

Short name for enabling in Studio: "signpost"

Note that Font Awesome icons are displayed exactly as written on the [Font Awesome list](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). This is a straight insertion into the normal 'class="fa fa-\[name\]"' attribute, so it's case-sensitive, i.e. 'book' will work, but 'Book' does not. Technically you could use this to append other classes, for example to use the Font Awesome animations, 'cog fa-spin fa-3x fa-fw'. You could also completely break the HTML in this way. Please don't.

The signpost uses H5, as this heading level is typically used in Open University courses. You may need to amend this to a level appropriate to your own instance. Similarly, the signpost is somewhat responsive, sending the icon across from the left to the center when the window size is smaller. You may need to amend this to fit your own platform's responsive design.
